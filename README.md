# AI-Farming-Friend-prototype
Here a prototype of machine learning project called "AI-Farming-Friend" is given also some code implementation on exploratory data analysis along with model building is done.
Target is to create a AI/ML service/product prototype which will help farmers in business growth. 
For that correct seed(crop), fertilizer selection along with monitoring crop to ensure health and growth (disease detection and weed detection) is necessary. 
Here EDA is done on crop selection data, also some ml models are tested for the same. CNN Model is also build for disease detection part and code is included.
