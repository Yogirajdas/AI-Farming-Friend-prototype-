# AI-Farming-Friend-prototype
Here a prototype of machine learning project called "AI-Farming-Friend" is given also some code implementation on exploratory data analysis along with model building is done.
Target is to create a AI/ML service/product prototype which will help farmers in business growth.
Here work is done based on kaggle dataset. The actual implementation will require more detailed dataset containing various more features of market situation, weather, time, region, etc. Also the performace of model will be required to near 99% for each case.
For that correct seed(crop), fertilizer selection along with monitoring crop to ensure health and growth (disease detection and weed detection) is necessary. 
Here EDA is done on crop selection data, also some ml models are tested for the same. CNN Model is also build for disease detection part and code is included. In the similar way For fertillizer and weed detection we can get results.
